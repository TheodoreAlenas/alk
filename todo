the executables should go to ~/.local/share/alsnip so they can be found

there should be an one size fits all interface, called alsnip,
and alm-snippet should only parse in different formats.

Alright, now I can see the project with a fresh pair of eyes.

Here are the methods that should be exposed, in order of depth:


Get a piece of functionality from the user.
Get a piece of copyable snippet from the user.
Run a piece of functionality.
Copy a snippet.
Show help for a piece.

Present, `show off' pieces that fit certain criteria.
Show help, given an ID and maybe the agent.
Run some code. Takes:
  should_store
  show{temporary, permanent, dont},
  paint_script (optional)
  script
Copy a piece of text.

Get what's to be ran, given an ID and maybe the agent.
Get what's to be copied, given an ID and maybe the agent.

Query pieces.
Get the
  ID,
  agent,
  snippet,
  short and long description,
  tags,
  colors.
Get the text of a description, perhaps with an option to color it.

m1 | volume   | pacmd set-sink-volume 0 21000
m2 | volume   | pacmd set-sink-volume 0 42000
m3 | volume   | pacmd set-sink-volume 0 84000
m4 | volume   | pacmd set-sink-volume 0 21000
m5 | volume   | pacmd set-sink-volume 0 42000
m6 | volume   | pacmd set-sink-volume 0 84000
7  | desktop  | bspc desktop (uh oh)

Okay this isn't a very good example is it.
Things that have some mathematical something might need
to be produced by a program.

Actually if the autocomplete things need to be turned into
separate commands, then we're screwed. Especially if this
means files. The ID would be messed up, perhaps we shouldn't
use an ID then.


I'd like the bar at the bottom to say something like
