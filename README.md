# Old hotkey system I made

I'm uploading the files on GitHub to enrich my portfolio.
This system of hotkeys is pretty bad.
It's old and it wasn't version controlled,
and of course I abandoned it. My current one is
in my dotfiles, it's the file
[https://github.com/TheodoreAlenas/dotfiles/blob/main/c/scmd.sh](scmd.sh).

It can print a list of key bindings and it can take CLI arguments
that correspond to hotkeys.
